# python-for-computer-vision
## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my foundational work in Computer Vision using Python and OpenCV.
It focuses on understanding how images are represented, accessed, and modified programmatically.

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

Day 1:
- Environment setup (VS Code, OpenCV)
- Read and display images
- First GitHub commit

Day 2:
- Understanding image shape and color channels
- Grayscale vs color images
- Pixel intensity values (0–255)

Day 3:
- Pixel access using array indexing
- Image slicing and ROI selection
- Rescaling images with custom functions

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Reading and displaying images
- Images as NumPy arrays
- Image shape (height, width, channels)
- Pixel access and manipulation
- Image slicing and Region of Interest (ROI)
- Rescaling images using custom functions
