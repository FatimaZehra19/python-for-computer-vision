# python-for-computer-vision
## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my foundational work in Computer Vision using Python and OpenCV.
It focuses on understanding how images are represented, accessed, and modified programmatically.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Reading and displaying images
- Images as NumPy arrays
- Image shape (height, width, channels)
- Pixel access and manipulation

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python numpy
2. Run any script:
   python filename.py

---

## 📈 Status
Actively expanding with daily learning and experiments.
